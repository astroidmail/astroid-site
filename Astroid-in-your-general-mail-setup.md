Astroid is a Mail User Agent. As such, all Astroid provides is a graphical interface to your email. Thus, Astroid enables you to launch actions that rely on the performance of other programs to actually fetch, sync, index, search and send your email.

A typical mail setup using Astroid can include:

 - [OfflineIMAP] to fetch/sync your mail between your local computer and an email service provider 
 - [notmuch] to index and search your mail
 - [msmtp] to send your mail through your email service provider
 - astroid to read, view, write, modify, organise your mail through a graphical interface.

[msmtp]: http://msmtp.sourceforge.net/
[offlineimap]: http://offlineimap.org/
[notmuch]: https://notmuchmail.org/

While all these programs (or equivalent programs) need to be setup; once they're configured, you shouldn't need to think about them beyond using astroid.

The configuration options may be more or less tedious and complicated, depending on what email service provider you use. For instance, Gmail has a lot of special configuration needed.
