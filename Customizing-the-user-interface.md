You can copy the original HTML and CSS file from the [ui/ directory](https://github.com/gauteh/astroid/tree/master/ui) to `.config/astroid/ui/` and then customize them to your own needs. Astroid will check if the version is correct (do not change it yourself), in case changes are made to the CSS and HTML upstream, and log an error if not.
